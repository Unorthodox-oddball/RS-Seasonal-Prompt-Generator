1. Addition of Input Parameters:
The revised version adds two input parameters: clothes and accessory. These parameters determine whether to include clothes and accessories respectively.
The wanna_shot parameter is now set to "No" by default, and its label has been changed to "wanna shot?".

2. Separation of Fashion Generation Logic:
The revised version introduces a method called get_fashion which separates the logic for generating fashion based on the season.
This method takes into account the clothes and accessory input values to select fashion items.

3. Separation of Background and Situation Logic:
The revised version adds a method called get_background_and_situation which separates the logic for generating background and additional situations.
This method returns background information and additional situation descriptions suitable for the given season.

1. Improved wanna_shot Logic:
Modified to reflect season and fashion information instead of completely ignoring the existing logic.
When wanna_shot is "Yes", the prompt now includes the season name, fashion information, and caf√©-related details.

2. Code Optimization:
Simplified Path Settings and Data Loading: Simplified the path constants and the path setting parts.
Unified Data Loading Function: Enhanced the load_data_from_csv function to also be used when loading lists.
Removed Redundant Code: Handled the if wanna_shot == "Yes" condition first to avoid redundancy with other conditions.
Used List Comprehensions: Used list comprehensions in loading additional situations to make the code more concise.
Improved Exception Handling: Added exception handling in data loading functions to notify the user in case of errors.

1. Extended Background Selection Feature:
Added random option to background selection.
Added "random" option to the background parameter in the INPUT_TYPES method to allow random selection of background.
Added logic in the generate_prompt function to randomly choose between "on" and "off" when background is set to "random".

2. Easter Egg Feature Addition:
Added a new choice wanna shot? with options Yes / No.
Added wanna_shot parameter in the INPUT_TYPES method.
Modified the generate_prompt function to generate a specific cafe-related prompt (e.g., "Cafe, coffee, holding a tumbler, straw inside the tumbler") if wanna_shot is set to "Yes", bypassing the regular prompt generation logic.

1. Implementing CSV Data Loading Functions:
load_data_from_csv: Added a function to load data from a CSV file.
load_list_from_csv: Added a function to load list data from a CSV file.
load_additional_situations: Added a function to load additional situation data.

2. Modifying Seed Generation:
Used random.randint(0, 9999999999999999) in the INPUT_TYPES method to ensure a maximum 16-digit seed value.
Set the default seed value to a maximum of 16 digits.

3. Adding Seed Limitation Logic:
Added logic within the generate_prompt function to limit the seed value to 16 digits when converting it to an integer, using str(seed)[:16].
Safely handles cases where the seed exceeds 16 digits by using only the first 16 digits.

4. Improving Season Selection Feature:
Added a 'random' option to season selection, allowing users to either choose a season directly or select one randomly.
Added logic to randomly select a season when the season parameter is set to "random".

5. Setting Absolute Paths for CSV Files:
Set all CSV file paths relative to the data directory as absolute paths.
Set paths for seasonal_fashion_path, seasonal_backgrounds_path, seasonal_weather_path, seasonal_times_path, additional_situations_path, general_composition_path, gaze_direction_path, poses_path, and body_directions_path using the data_dir variable.

6. Implementing Prompt Generation Function:
Load fashion items corresponding to the season.
Select tops/bottoms or dresses.
Load information such as background, weather, time, etc.
Select additional situations.
Generate the prompt.
